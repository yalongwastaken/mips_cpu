# MIPS CPU Project

## Description

The MIPS CPU project is a simple processor based on the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA), implemented in Verilog. The design is synthesized using Cadence tools, ensuring compatibility with standard ASIC design flows. The design is targeted for fabrication using the AMI 0.5 standard cell library.

## About

The MIPS CPU project is developed by Anthony Yalong, a Computer Engineering student at The George Washington University, with a background in digital design, computer architecture, and embedded systems. The project focuses on fundamental CPU architecture and instruction execution using hardware description languages. By implementing a MIPS processor, the project aims to deepen the understanding of CPU architecture, instruction execution, and hardware optimization techniques.
