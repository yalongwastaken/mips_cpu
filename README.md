# MIPS CPU Project

## Description

The MIPS CPU project is a simple processor based on the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA), implemented in Verilog and designed using Cadence tools. The design is synthesized using Synopsys tools, ensuring compatibility with standard ASIC design flows. The design is targeted for fabrication using the AMI 0.5 standard cell library.
